I have used .NET 5.0 to develop this web API. You can see all endpoints when you run the project with Swagger. 


# Scenario
People can see the products that you sell without register. When a person registers the service, they can order products. The ordering system works like this: Customer selects a product and adds it to the cart. When the customer executes orders, the system sends a mail to your mail address. The mail contains the name, address, and phone number of the customer also the products that the customer has ordered.
